# android_webshop

This app has login and signup page for the user.
The id and password is saved in the local databse of the system. After login, the user is taken to the category
activity where the user has to select boys or girls. Then accordingly the products of t-shirts are displayed in
the next activity using recycler view. The user can select multiple products with as many quantity needed. 
Then payment activity is made for the payment of the items in the cart. We have used the PAYPAL payment gateway
for the purpose. Here, I have used to concept of splash screen, recycler view and web services through PHP.
The concept of web services sends data from the app to a server in PHP with MySQL database.
